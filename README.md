# Inzu-Recipes

Here in this project I'm not experiment with skills that I have learnt so far from "The Odind Project"
By the time am doing this project I have completed 40% of this foundation course of web development.
Coming this far I have already been Hooked up to this! 
PS: Parmado technique works like gem.

Things I have learnt so far are:
* How to create a new repository in GIT
* Few basics of GIT
* What are HTML,CSS,Javascript?
* HTML basics

------------
These were the things I could think of before starting the project coming forward I'll be updating this file as well.
